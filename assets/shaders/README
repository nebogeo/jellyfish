The Fluxus GLSL Shader Library
------------------------------

This collection is a basic set of standalone shaders for you to use 
or modify to suit your needs. These shaders don't have any fluxus
specific code, so they should be suitable for use in any application 
supporting GLSL.

They are currently very much inspired by illumination models used for
general renderman shaders. There is no texturing support yet, this 
will be added later, probably along with some more interesting NPR 
rendering shaders.
